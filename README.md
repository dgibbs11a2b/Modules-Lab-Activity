Here is a description of each Python program, its respective file name, and its intended purpose.

1.	Randomrange.py – This program uses the random module, specifically “random.randrange” to generate ten integers between the values of 25 and 25.

2.	Randomint.py – This program uses the random module, specifically “random.randrange” to print an odd integer between 0 and 100. The first example is my primary example and then I've offered a secondary example.

3.	Randomday.py - This program uses the random module, specifically “random.choice”, to select a random day from the list of 7 days in a week. It will then display the randomly selected day to the screen

4.	Pi.py - This program computes the approximation of pi using the math module.
It uses series addition and uses a for loop to count from 1 to 10 million
in steps of 4.

5.	Degrees.py - This program allows you to convert radians to degrees. It receives your input and will echo your input back to you and then display the calculated value.

6.	Factorial.py - This program receives input from the user as a positive integer. Your entry is echoed to the screen. It will then use a for loop to calculate the factorial of this input value and display it to the screen.
